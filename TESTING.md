### Tested navigation links.
All navigation links on desktop and mobile were tested to make sure they linked to the relevant pages.


## Browser testing
- The desktop App was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers, to check for responsive layouts and functionality on all pages. I tested all page layouts on a number of screensizes, which all proved responsive to the screen size. I tested website functionality on all browsers to cheeck that users were able to navigate through all pages, add, edit and delete recipe, ingredients and categories. The homepage view is illustrated below:  
![Desktop browser views](screenshots/desktop-browser-views.png)
## Responsive layouts testing
- The App was tested on a series of devices to check the layouts automatically adapt to different devices with different screen sizes. I took a mobile first approach to responsive design; for example on the home page, the layout changes from a one column layout on mobile screens. This meant the user experience was as good, whether the site was viewed on a small mobile device or large desktop screen.
- Mobile screen - Iphone 12 pro:  
![iphone12 pro layouts](screenshots/testing-iphone12-pro.png). 
- Tablet layout - iPad mini   
![iPad mini layouts](screenshots/testing-ipad-mini.png)
- Medium screen - Surface Pro7:

- Large screen - iMac 27"   
![Imac 27" layouts](screenshots/testing-imac-27.png) 

## Device testing CRUD functionality
- I tested adding a recipe record on iPhone 11 device, then edited it and deleted it without any issues.
- I tested adding a recipe record on iMac 27‚Äù device, then edited it and deleted it without any issues.
- I tested adding a recipe record on MacBook 13" device, then edited it and deleted it without any issues.
- I tested adding a recipe record on Microsoft Surface device, then edited it and deleted it without any issues.

# Validation
### HTML validation:
I tested the app with the [W3C HTML checker](https://validator.w3.org/) and it indicated the following warnings:
- Warning: Section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements to add identifying headings to all sections, or else use a div element instead for any cases where no heading is needed. The reason for this is that the html (div and h4 headings) were hidden from the validator due to the jinga templating language.  
![HTML validation](https://github.com/fatimagama20/food-receipe/blob/main/foodrecipe/static/Features/htmlresult.png?raw=true). 
### CSS validation
I tested style.css file with the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and no error was found.  
![CSS validation](https://github.com/fatimagama20/food-receipe/blob/main/foodrecipe/static/Features/cssresult.png?raw=true)
### Javascript validation
The script.js was tested by [Jshint online checker](https://jshint.com/) Two warnings were issued about the let variable keyword being available in ES6 version since 2015. 
![Javascript warning](https://github.com/fatimagama20/food-receipe/blob/main/foodrecipe/static/Features/javascriptresult.png?raw=true)
### Python validation
I tested routes.py file with [PEP8 Online Check](http://pep8online.com/) and the file is PEP8 compliant.  
![PEP8 compliant](screenshots/pep8-online-validation.png)

## Confirmation message examples
Throughout testing I have referred to the 'flash messages' that inform the user when they have completed an action within the app. Some of these are illustrated below:
![Flash message examples](screenshots/flash-message-examples.png)

## Performance testing
I tested the app with Lighthouse in Chrome Dev Tools. Whilst the scores were good especially for best practices, the app would be improved primarily by reducing the size of the images used, in order to improve page load speed.

       * Offering comprehensive information on ingredients.

       *  Provide step-by-step cooking procedures

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to add, edit, and delete ingredients.

        * At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to able to add,edit, and delete categories


 *  Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, to be able to check to see if there are any newly added reviews about the recipe.

    2. As a Frequent User, to be able to search a recipe.

       * The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily search the recipes.

   2. As a Frequent User, to be able to add recipe by different people.
