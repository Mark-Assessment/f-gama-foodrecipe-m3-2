# About Foodrecipe

A recipe is a set of instructions that describes how to prepare or make something, especially a dish of prepared food.

##  Foodrecipe goals

This food recipe app allows users to sift through tons of recipes, and check cooking intructions. It also lets users know the main ingredients, and the type of meal, which the user wants to make.

* ## Design
  * ### Colour Scheme
    
    I have chosen to use the blue and white as the main colour, alongside grey and black, as well as using the accent colours red and light green.   
    Red is used as a warning colour on buttons used for deletion. Green accent is used for the edit button to easily differentiate the buttons.
  
    * Card colour - #03a9f4
    * Delete button - #888e5f
    * Edit button - #F44336
    * Text colour - #fff

# Further Testing
* The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
* The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
* A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
* Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
# Known Bugs

# Credits
## Code
* [Bootstrap 5.0:](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) Bootstrap was used significantly throughout the project to make it responsive. I used the Grid system as well as inputting a fixed-top navbar, a progress bar and contact form.

* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) was used to help me style the navbar text colour and was used in HTML to close the navbar when a link is clicked on mobile.

* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) was used to provide a smooth scroll to the website and to style the contact form and the submit button.

* [Courses.Code Institute](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/ci_program/level5diplomainwebappdevelopment) was used to style the progress bars and I used the demonstrated jQuery for the contact form.
